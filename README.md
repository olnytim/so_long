# :joystick: so_long Project - 42 School

![Game Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## :book: Description

Welcome to the "so_long" project! This project is part of the curriculum at 42 School and focuses on building a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX library. In this game, you'll navigate through a maze-like map, collecting items while avoiding obstacles. It's a great introduction to graphics programming.

## :star2: Features

- Basic graphics rendering using MiniLibX.
- Player movement with keyboard input.
- Map parsing from a text file.
- Collectible items (coins, perhaps?) to be gathered.
- Obstacles (walls, maybe?) that must be navigated around.

## :computer: Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/so_long.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd so_long
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```
   make
   ```

## :video_game: Usage

Run the game with a map file (use one from the "maps" directory or create your own):

```
./so_long maps/map.ber
```

## :world_map: Maps

Check out the sample map files in the `maps` directory. Each map is represented as a text file where:

- '1' represents a wall (obstacle).
- '0' represents an empty space.
- 'P' represents the player's starting position.
- 'C' represents collectible items.
- 'E' represents the map exit.
